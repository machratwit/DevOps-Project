DevOps Project: End-to-End CI/CD with Terraform, Docker, AWS, and GitHub Actions
Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, production-style DevOps workflow using Infrastructure as Code, containerization, and CI/CD automation. The system provisions AWS infrastructure with Terraform, builds and scans a Dockerized Node.js application, pushes images to Amazon ECR, and deploys the application to an EC2 instance automatically using GitHub Actions.

The focus of this project is end-to-end ownership: infrastructure, security, pipelines, deployment, and runtime.
